Many thought that would be a given with a quirk like Foresight. But how does an anxiety-riddled, resting-bitch-faced, type-A-personalitied, underground hero tell the world that it's actually because she was reborn into one of her favorite animes?

Answer: she doesn't. Instead, she tries (and fails) to stick to canon, forges herself a found family out of civilians, heroes, and baby villains alike, and prays to God Nedzu that it all works out for the best.

Or: a self-insert really wants to take a backseat and watch canon continue from a distance, but that's hard to do when she keeps stumbling over distressed kids and adding them to her found family like a dragon adding gold to its hoard.

Featuring: an author exposing themselves, paperwork, and a fumbling All Might trying to navigate having shared custody with an underground hero.",36/?,"125,305",Last visited: 11 Feb 2025 (Latest version.) Visited 6 times,https://archiveofourown.org/works/32876614

The question echoed like a dark whisper in her consciousness, revealing a disturbing discrepancy between the present and the accounts of the past.

Instead, much to her agitation, she found herself in the World of Ice and Fire, born as Jocasta Lannister, the eldest daughter of Tywin 'The King without a Crown' and his wife Joanna Lannister, in the climax of the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion.

She soon finds herself in a dizzy, surreal set of events as she befriends the most unlikely people, her actions sending ripples all across Westeros as magic returns to the world once more, bringing back Dragons and the slumbering White Walkers as the ones long dead are given life for a reason far more sinister than she could have thought.

Things change drastically as a new player emerges in the Game, and the stakes seem higher than ever before. Jocasta finds herself and her band of misfits attempting to navigate the hot waters of King's Landing, unearthing conspiracies, prophecies, learning the secrets of Queer Gods each more terrifying than the last and dabbling in dark sorcery and magic.

Time is ticking by, but Jocasta will prove that though the dragons may rule the sky, it is the lions who rule the land below.",12/?,"44,240",Last visited: 18 Jan 2025 (Latest version.) Visited 10 times,https://archiveofourown.org/works/39516756

Now she had been thrown into another fight for the throne and she is done. She just wants be done and not be a victim for people playing gods. Then she meets them and sees that they are much different then she thought they would be and she struggles to reconcile the history and the real people they are.
